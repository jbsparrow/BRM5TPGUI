# Black Hawk Rescue Mission 5 Teleport GUI
jbsparrow#5747 Black Hawk Rescue Mission 5 (BRM5) Teleportation GUI <br/> https://www.roblox.com/games/2916899287/ <br/>
Completely redesigned the GUI, much more clean to use, there is now a toggle keybind and different tabs. The GUI isn't translucent right now making it a bit annoying to use because your cursor gets hidden behind the GUI by BRM but for now it's stuck being ugly.

Here's the loadstring for it: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbsparrow/BRM5TPGUI/main/gui.lua"))();`
